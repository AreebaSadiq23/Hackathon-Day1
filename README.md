Bandage E-commerce Website

1. Project Overview
This project focuses on building the technical foundation for a marketplace, transitioning from business-oriented planning to technical implementation. The goal is to create a scalable, functional, and user-friendly marketplace that aligns with real-world business needs.

2. Features Overview

Key features of the marketplace include:

Responsive design for both mobile and desktop platforms.

Dynamic product listing powered by APIs.

Sanity CMS for managing content, including products, orders, and customers.

Integration with third-party APIs for shipment tracking and secure payment processing.

3. System Architecture

The system architecture outlines the interaction between the marketplaceâ€™s core components:
[Frontend (React/Next.js)]
      |
[Sanity CMS] -----> [Product Data API]
      |
[Third-Party APIs] --> [Shipment Tracking & Payment Gateway]

Workflows include:
User Registration: User data is stored in Sanity CMS and a confirmation is sent.

Product Browsing: Product data fetched from Sanity CMS is displayed dynamically on the frontend.

Order Placement: Orders are created in Sanity CMS, and payments are processed securely.

Shipment Tracking: Real-time shipment updates are fetched through third-party APIs.

4. API Details

/products** (GET):** Fetch all product details (e.g., name, price, stock, image).

/orders** (POST):** Create a new order with customer and product details.

/shipment** (GET):** Fetch shipment status, including expected delivery date.

Example Response for /products:
