<h1>Component Breakdown</h1>
<h2>Frontend (Next.js + TypeScript):</h2>
<li>Provides a fast, SEO-friendly, and dynamic user interface.</li>
<li>Fully integrated with the backend using server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG).</li>

<h1>Backend (Sanity CMS):</h1>
<li>Central hub for managing product data, orders, and user-generated content.</li>
<li>Supports custom APIs to communicate with the frontend and external services.</li>

<h1>Services Layer:</h1>
<li>Shipping API (EasyPost): Facilitates shipment tracking and label generation.</li>
<li>Payment Gateway (Stripe): Handles secure transactions with built-in fraud protection.</li>

<h1>Authentication (Clerk):</h1>
<li>Handles user sign-up, login, and session management.</li>
<li>Securely stores and manages user data integrated with Sanity CMS.</li>

<h1>Key Workflows</h1>
<h3>1. Key Workflows</h3>
<li>Users sign up or log in using Clerk authentication.</li>
<li>Clerk securely manages authentication tokens, and user profiles are linked to Sanity CMS.</li>

<h3>2. Product Browsing:</h3>
<li>Products are fetched from Sanity CMS and rendered dynamically on the frontend.</li>
<li>Filters, search options, and sorting enhance the user experience.</li>

<h3>3. Cart Management:</h3>

<li>Orders are logged in Sanity CMS, and a receipt is emailed to the user.</li>

<h3>5. Order Tracking:</h3>
<li>After checkout, shipping details are generated via EasyPost.</li>
<li>Users can track their orders in real-time from their account dashboard.</li>

  <h1>Sanity CMS Schema Example</h1>

  import { defineType, defineField } from "sanity";

export default defineType({
  name: "product",
  title: "Product",
  type: "document",
  fields: [
    defineField({
      name: "title",
      title: "Product Title",
      type: "string",
      validation: (Rule) => Rule.required(),
    }),
    defineField({
      name: "price",
      title: "Price",
      type: "number",
      validation: (Rule) => Rule.required().min(0),
    }),
    defineField({
      name: "stock",
      title: "Stock Quantity",
      type: "number",
      validation: (Rule) => Rule.required().min(0),
